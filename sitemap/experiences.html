	<h1> My most current work experience... </h1>
	<p> I have worked as an Accountant for the previous <span style="color:red"> <b>4 years</b></span>.  
		I have faced many challenges in this job for I was the only accountant in the company.  Therefore, 
		the first few weeks of this job was challenging.  Fortunately, with dedication and
		faith, I have overcame these challenges. </p>

	<h1> Previous work experience... </h1>
		<p> I was a sales associate at Future Shop.  I've landed in this job as a seasonal for
			Christmas, it was a really fun experience and I have met many valuable friends.
			I have learned many sales techniques from fellow co-workers, and many valuable lessons
			from the General Manager.  Much is appreciated. </p>
